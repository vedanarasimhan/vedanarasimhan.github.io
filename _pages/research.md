## Polity size and local government performance: Evidence from India (*Revise & Resubmit* at American Economic Review) 

### With [Jeffrey Weaver](https://www.jeff-weaver.com), 
Developing countries have increasingly decentralized power to local governments. This
paper studies a central element of decentralization – polity size – using population-based
discontinuities that determine local government boundaries for over 100,000 Indian
villages. Over the short and long-run, individuals allocated into local governments
with smaller populations have better access to public goods. However, this relationship
is non-linear, with benefits only observed below certain population thresholds. We
provide evidence that these results are explained by greater civic engagement and improved
leader selection in those jurisdictions. We find no evidence for other theorized
mechanisms such as elite capture.'

## Rural Development, Migration & Aggregate Growth: Evidence from India

### (New draft coming soon)

This paper considers a potential channel of rural development that may help to generate growth and encourage rural-urban migration. I use a 1992 reform in India that decentralized power to local village councils, I look at the role that political institutions play in influencing rural economic development, and the impact that this has on aggregate growth. I utilize a regression discontinuity design (RDD) based on population thresholds
for the state of Uttar Pradesh that determined eligibility for independent village councils versus shared councils, and aggregate it to the district-level to study aggregate economic impacts. I find that villages
with an independent political unit have marginally differential economic activity, a greater provision of infrastructure-related public goods, and higher population growth. At the district-level I find that this
population growth seems to be driven predominantly by rural-rural migration, but a surprising result is that rural-urban migration is higher for districts with a higher share of independent village councils. I
provide suggestive evidence that improvements at the local-level help to drive down migration frictions associated with rural-urban migration which drives this finding. Finally, I show that the changes at the
local-level have a positive impact on district-level GDP.
