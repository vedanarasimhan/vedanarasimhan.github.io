[__Polity size and local government performance: Evidence from India__](https://www.dropbox.com/s/re5mn4tv5jgq1t0/UP_decentralization_small.pdf?dl=0) with [Jeffrey Weaver](https://www.jeff-weaver.com)

(*Revise & Resubmit* at the American Economic Review)

Developing countries have increasingly decentralized power to local governments. This
paper studies a central element of decentralization – polity size – using population-based
discontinuities that determine local government boundaries for over 100,000 Indian
villages. Over the short and long-run, individuals allocated into local governments
with smaller populations have better access to public goods. However, this relationship
is non-linear, with benefits only observed below certain population thresholds. We
provide evidence that these results are explained by greater civic engagement and improved
leader selection in those jurisdictions. We find no evidence for other theorized
mechanisms such as elite capture.

## Work in Progress

__Rural Development, Migration & Aggregate Growth: Evidence from India__ *(New draft coming soon)*

This paper examines the effects of rural development policies on economic growth and rural-urban migration in developing countries, using a 1992 reform in India. Despite traditional economic models emphasizing urban migration, rural populations remain high in low-income countries. Using a regression discontinuity design for Uttar Pradesh, I analyze the impact of independent versus shared village councils on economic activity, infrastructure, and population growth. I find that villages with independeny councils witness improved economic activity, enhanced infrastructure, and heightened population growth. While rural-rural migration primarily drives this population surge, districts with more independent councils surprisingly show increased rural-urban migration. This suggests that local-level enhancements reduce migration barriers, thus boosting rural-urban shifts, and ultimately benefiting district-level GDP.


__Aggregate Regression Discontinuity Design__ with [Jordan Norris](https://www.jordanjnorris.com) and [Zheng Wang](https://www.zhengwangeconomics.com) 

We generalize the regression discontinuity design (RDD) to identify the effect of a binary treat- ment on aggregated outcomes. The treatment is at the unit level, and units are partitioned into groups. We assume a partial interference structure, where arbitrary interference among units within a group is allowed, but not interference across groups. In this environment, we show that the standard RDD assumption of imperfect control at the cutoff is sufficient for the identification of the effect of the unit- level treatment on the group-level aggregated outcomes. In addition, we derive estimators to estimate the non-linear effect of the number of treated units on the group-level outcomes. We demonstrate our methodology empirically to study the effect of a more uniform partisan composition across US regions on spatial tax competition.


__Checkpoints and Local Economic Development__ with [Barthélémy Bonadio](https://sites.google.com/view/bbonadio/home)

We examine the impact of a 2017 reform in India that eliminated interstate checkpoints and digitized the process of transporting goods across state borders. The reform generated a significant reduction in inter-state trade barriers and administrative burdens, resulting in a decline in the overall concentration of economic activity near state borders. More specifically, we show that this exogenous shock to location-based forces, generated an overall decline in local economic patterns, and we provide evidence on what characteristics enabled a market to sustain itself despite the removal of these traditional forces of attraction. This quasi-experimental approach provides insights into the dynamics of economic activity in response to policy changes affecting trade and transport.
