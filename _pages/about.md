Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor at NYU-Abu Dhabi, working on applied microeconomic topics with a focus on political economy, economic development, and growth. 

My research uses empirical tools to understand the role of institutions and policy in driving local development, public good provision, and migration. 

I received my PhD from the Department of Economics at the University of Zurich in 2022. 

**Research interests:** Political Economy, Economic Development, Migration, Public Goods, Spatial Economics
