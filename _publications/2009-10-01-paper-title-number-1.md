title: "Polity size, decentralization intensity, and public goods provision: evidence from India"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'Developing countries have increasingly moved towards political decentralization and
devolution of power to elected local governments. An important aspect of this process
is the division of the population into distinct local government units. This paper
examines the consequences of these divisions using data from over 100,000 villages in
the largest state of India and population-based discontinuities that determine local
government boundaries. Over both the short and long-run, individuals allocated into
local governments with smaller populations have better access to a broad range of
public programs and amenities. However, the relationship is non-linear, where these
positive effects are only present when allocated to jurisdictions below a certain size.
We provide evidence that these results can be explained by greater civic engagement
and improved selection of candidates in smaller jurisdictions, but find no evidence
of other theorized mechanisms such as elite capture. These results are informative
as to the optimal degree of decentralization and indicate scope for more significant
decentralization in many contexts.'

Developing countries have increasingly moved towards political decentralization and
devolution of power to elected local governments. An important aspect of this process
is the division of the population into distinct local government units. This paper

the largest state of India and population-based discontinuities that determine local
government boundaries. Over both the short and long-run, individuals allocated into
