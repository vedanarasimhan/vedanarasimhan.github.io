This paper considers a potential channel of rural development that may help to generate growth and encourage rural-urban migration. I use a 1992 reform in India that decentralized power to local village councils, I look at the role that political institutions play in influencing rural economic development, and the impact that this has on aggregate growth. I utilize a regression discontinuity design (RDD) based on population thresholds
for the state of Uttar Pradesh that determined eligibility for independent village councils versus shared councils, and aggregate it to the district-level to study aggregate economic impacts. I find that villages
with an independent political unit have marginally differential economic activity, a greater provision of infrastructure-related public goods, and higher population growth. At the district-level I find that this
population growth seems to be driven predominantly by rural-rural migration, but a surprising result is that rural-urban migration is higher for districts with a higher share of independent village councils. I
provide suggestive evidence that improvements at the local-level help to drive down migration frictions associated with rural-urban migration which drives this finding. Finally, I show that the changes at the
local-level have a positive impact on district-level GDP.
