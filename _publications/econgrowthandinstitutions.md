'Traditional models of economic development focus on moving people from rural areas to urban areas.
In lower income countries however, the majority of individuals continue to live in rural areas. This
has generated concern that development policy focused mainly on rural areas may decrease migration
and hence negatively impact economic development by keeping people in villages. This paper considers
a potential channel of rural development that may help to generate growth and encourage rural-urban
migration. I use a 1992 reform in India that decentralized power to local village councils, I look at the role
that political institutions play in influencing rural economic development, and the impact that this has
on aggregate growth. I utilize a regression discontinuity design (RDD) based on population thresholds
for the state of Uttar Pradesh that determined eligibility for independent village councils versus shared
councils, and aggregate it to the district-level to study aggregate economic impacts. I find that villages
with an independent political unit have marginally differential economic activity, a greater provision of
infrastructure-related public goods, and higher population growth. At the district-level I find that this
population growth seems to be driven predominantly by rural-rural migration, but a surprising result is
that rural-urban migration is higher for districts with a higher share of independent village councils. I
provide suggestive evidence that improvements at the local-level help to drive down migration frictions
associated with rural-urban migration which drives this finding. Finally, I show that the changes at the
local-level have a positive impact on district-level GDP.'
