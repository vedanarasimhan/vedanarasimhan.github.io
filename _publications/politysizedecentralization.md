title: "Polity size and local government performance: Evidence from India"
collection: research
permalink: /research/politysizedecentralization
excerpt: 'With [Jeffrey Weaver](https://www.jeff-weaver.com).  <br />
   <br />
Developing countries have increasingly decentralized power to local governments. This
paper studies a central element of decentralization – polity size – using populationbased
discontinuities that determine local government boundaries for over 100,000 Indian
villages. Over the short and long-run, individuals allocated into local governments
with smaller populations have better access to public goods. However, this relationship
is non-linear, with benefits only observed below certain population thresholds. We
provide evidence that these results are explained by greater civic engagement and improved
leader selection in those jurisdictions. We find no evidence for other theorized
mechanisms such as elite capture.'
